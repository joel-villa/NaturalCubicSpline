## Interpolating tanh(x) Using the Natural Cubic Spline

### Task 1

Approximate tanh(x) on [−3, 3] by using 11 equally space nodes and constructing the interpolating polynomial Pn(x). Compare results with the interpolating cubic spline S(x) constructed with those same nodes.

### Findings

### Task 2

Explore a larger interval [−5, 5] as well as more knots/nodes
